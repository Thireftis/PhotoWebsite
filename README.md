# PhotoWebsite
This project was made by me for a friend and her work.
As said in the description, the photos used in it are missing because I do not own them.
The website was made to have a main page with the name of the photographer, as every other page to have a menu on top for each other page and a footer in the bottom with contact information.
Every page had it's own background image and contained either photos or information for the photographer herself, the review page included screenshots of her clients' reviews of her work.
